        <h1>About Hamza</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            I'm Hamza, a grade 10 student currently attending Pembina Trails
            Early College (PTEC) & Fort Richmond Collegiate. In my spare time,
            you can find me playing various sports such as squash, taekwondo,
            hockey, soccer and many more! I also enjoy biking and volunteering
            in the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            I excel and perform very well in academics and maintain a 98%
            average whilst receiving many academic awards in STEM-related
            competitions. I am a focused, hard-working and dedicated student
            with strong work ethics.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to being athletic and focused in academics, I regularly
            assist in the community - whether it be raising money for charities,
            babysitting, or teaching programming to aspiring kids.
          </p>
